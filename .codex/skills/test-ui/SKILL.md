# Test UI

Use this skill for manual-style, end-to-end tests of the program's text interface. Test cases are recorded in `test/ui-test-plan.md`; do not invent undocumented cases during a run.

## Test plan

Maintain `test/ui-test-plan.md` with the project command configuration and one section per test case. Each case must include:

- an `Aim` explaining what behavior is being tested;
- an `Inputs` fenced `text` block containing the commands sent to one fresh program session, one command per line; and
- an `Expected output` fenced `text` block containing the exact output expected from that session.

The plan may specify an optional build command, working directory, and timeout. The bundled runner uses the repository root by default and treats output differences other than line-ending style as failures.

## Run the tests

From the repository root, run:

```text
python .codex/skills/test-ui/scripts/run_ui_tests.py --plan test/ui-test-plan.md
```

The runner executes the optional build command once, then starts a fresh program process for each test case. It prints each session's console input and output. A failing case prints the expected and actual output, returns a non-zero exit code, and stops without running later cases.

Do not continue after a failure or silently update expected output. Report the failing test case and its actual-versus-expected output so the user can decide whether the implementation or the plan should change.

The runner uses only Python's standard library; no package installation is required.
